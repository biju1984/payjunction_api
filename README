This is not the official PayJunction API. At the time of creating this api PayJunction did not have an library api in PHP. So check of updates from http://developer.payjunction.com/. It's always safe to use PayJunction API if they have one.

= Installation

Obtain the latest version of the PayJunction api with:

    git clone https://github.com/biju1984/payjunction_api.git

To get started, add the following to your PHP script:

    require_once("/path/to/api/payjunction_api.php");

Simple usage looks like:

	$payjunction = new PayJunctionApi($username,$password,$api_key,$test_mode);

	Eg: $payjunction = new PayJunctionApi('pj-ql-01','pj-ql-01p','53ced679-c314-418e-99ec-d302370cfbe5',true); 

	// API key, username & password is obtained from PayJunction upon registration.

	For processing transaction and getting JSON response:

	$response = $payjunction->processTransaction($fields,$transaction_id,$request);

	Eg: $fields = array(
			'cardNumber' => ''
			'cardExpMonth' => ''
			'cardExpYear' => ''
			'billingAddress' => ''
			'billingCountry' =>  ''
			'billingState' => ''
			'billingZip' => ''
			'billingFirstName' => ''
			'billingLastName' => ''
			'cardCvv' => ''
			'amountBase' => ''
		); // Fill in the values. 

		$transaction_id = null / 123455; // By default null
		$request = "POST"/"GET"/"PUT" // By default POST
		$response is a JSON string which has to be parsed.
